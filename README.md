## Overview

QUT Classmate was built to help students more easily search for units, view class options, and build a personalized, conflict-free timetable. You can then export your schedule to a calendar app like Google Calendar. It looks good, works fast, and gets out of your way.

## Features

### ‚úÖ Unit Search
- Fast, accurate search by unit code (e.g. CAB202)
- See a table of class times, locations, and staff
- Button to view the unit directly in the Timetable Maker
- Grouped results by class type with clear week info and online/internal tags
- Sortable and rounded results table

### üóìÔ∏è Timetable Maker
- Select the classes you want, drag and drop them into your weekly view
- Conflicts highlighted (but not blocked)
- Class-type highlighting on hover
- Clean rounded design with sticky timetable layout
- Export your plan to `.ics` or Google Calendar
- Toggle between light and dark mode with cool animations

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Export / Import
- Export your final timetable as a `.ics` file or sync it with Google Calendar
- Each class exports individually and accurately
- Animations and clean UX for transitions

---

## Usage

1. **Search for Units**: Enter a valid QUT unit code (e.g. CAB202).
2. **Add to Timetable**: Select class times that work for you.
3. **Preview**: See your week view and adjust as needed.
4. **Export**: Download an `.ics` or sync directly to Google Calendar.
5. **Theme Toggle**: Use the switch to go light/dark with a smooth animated fade.

## How It Was Developed

This app was heavily assisted by AI-powered coding tools, primarily **v0** by Vercel, which helped generate and iterate on core functionality quickly. I worked a fair bit on parsing QUT's public timetable data but AI agents were used for:
- Building interactive UI components
- Improving accessibility and animations
- Designing calendar export features

It was an experiment in blending AI speed with human feedback to solve a real student problem that resulted in a working solution within a day which I think is insane!

## Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variable:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_QUT_VIRTUAL_API_URL` | The URL for QUT Virtual's timetable API | `https://qutvirtual3.qut.edu.au/qvpublic/ttab_unit_search_p.process_search` |
