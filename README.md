## How It Was Developed

The QUT Classmate App was primarily developed with the help of **AI-powered tools** to accelerate the development process. The project relied heavily on the use of **AI code generation** to generate key features such as:
- Timetable parsing and unit search functionality.
- Dynamic UI creation and responsiveness.
- Calendar integration (including Google Calendar and ICS file exports).
- The application design, with features like Dark Mode and clean layout structures, was generated based on user feedback and AI-driven suggestions for improving usability.

While the AI tools assisted in much of the coding, human input was also pivotal in finalizing the appâ€™s structure, design, and specific features, ensuring it meets the needs of QUT students.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Svelte (for the web version), TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Node.js (for any server-side operations if needed in the future).
- **APIs**: Integration with Google Calendar API for exporting timetables.
- **Tools**: AI-assisted coding for rapid development and functionality creation.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel for seamless deployment and easy scaling.

## Usage

1. **Search for Units**: Enter a unit code (e.g., CAB202) in the search bar to retrieve its timetable.
2. **Create Timetable**: Select the classes that work for you and add them to your personalized timetable.
3. **Export/Import**: Export your timetable to an .ICS file or directly to Google Calendar.
4. **Themes**: The app starts in Dark Mode by default, but you can switch to Light Mode using the toggle button.

## Changelog

Planned Features:
- Autocomplete search for units
- Google Calendar Integration
- Add a button next to each unit result that takes the user to the corresponding class in the Timetable Maker section on Unit Search
- When hovering over the activity types in the timetable (e.g., "LEC" or "PRC"), display all the classes of that activity type on the timetable grid (with 50% opacity for clarity) on Timetable Maker
- The information button for each unit in the Unit Search should be activated when clicked instead of on hover for better user interaction.
- Add more animation ;)
